# Weather App with HTML

A simple weather app that employs user input, openweathermap.org's API, and Google Maps' API.

## Description
This project would prompt the user for a city. This project has a file that contains the names of thousands of actual cities. It continues to prompt the user for a valid city, then once a valid city is entered,
it will pull the current weather data using openweathermap.org's API for current information. Then, the application prompts the user for input typically used on Google Maps. Using Google Maps' API and HTML, it
renders an pop-up with the specifications of the city, as well as the key 5 temperature statistics real-time from said city.


## Getting Started
-This application no longer runs because it was created in Spring 2022 and the APIs have since depracted. It could easily be redone and if I have time, I will.

### Executing program

-javac -cp ".;jars/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" myWeatherApp.java
